This app is designed to help people who are often busy and do not have much time to spend in the kitchen. 
With a simple tap you can get a random recipe, if we like it we can view the recipe otherwise we can generate another one.
<br>The app is entirely made in `SwiftUI` and thanks to `ImageRenderer` it also allows to export and save the recipe as a PDF.
